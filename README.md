Poor Man's MetaPost

This is an experimental fun project, currently without any practical purpose.
The first draft used ANTLR as a parser generator, but I intend to migrate it
to GoRGO as test case for GoRGO's shortcomings.

I don't strive for fance graphics, but rather aim at simple figures like this
one:
